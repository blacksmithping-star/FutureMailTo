# FutureMailTo

## What if you could write a letter today that arrives in 2035? Or send a heartfelt note to your future self on a milestone birthday? ü•∫ FutureMailTo makes it possible!

I built this little app where you can schedule emails to yourself or loved ones, years into the future. Think of it as a digital time capsule for your dreams, regrets, or hopes.

## Why?
Life is fleeting. Imagine someone opening your email in 2035, long after you're gone, and feeling your presence again. Or your future self stumbling upon a note from 2024, saying, "Hey, you survived!" üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è

## Features:
- Anonymous Access. Anyone can send letter anonymously.
- User can set schedule for next 10 Years!!
- Hasslefree Gmail sign-in Method. 
- Personal Dashboard. User can check status and manage emails.
- All emails are secured and private.
- Simple and Enhanced User Experience.

## How It Works:
1. Write your message.
2. Pick a future date.
3. Hit send.

Your email time-travels silently until its moment arrives.
